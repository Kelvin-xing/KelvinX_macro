    \begin{itemize}
        \item Two theories explaining growth: 1) \textbf{dual-economy.} draws distinction between agriculture as traditional and industry as modern sectors of economy. Different economic logics are at work within so cannot be lumped together. Accumulation innovation and productivity growth take place in the modern sector, the traditional sector remains technologically backward and stagnant. Labor and other resources migration rate to modern sector decides growth rate. Lewis 1954, Ranis and Fei 1961.\\
        2) \textbf{neoclassical growth model}. presumes different economic activity are structurally similar enough to aggregate into a representative sector. growth depends on the incentives to save, accumulate physical and human capital, and innovate by developing new products and processes. Solow 1956, Grossman and Helpman 1991, Aghion and Howitt 1992.
        \item two challenge: structural transformation and fundamentals. \textbf{Former}, ensure resources flow rapidly to high productivity. \textbf{Latter}, on broad and long-run growth two driving forces: quality of institutions(governance, law, biz environment) or the level of human capital(education, skills, training). Acemoglu Johnson Robinson 2001, Glaeser et al 2004.
        \item Results
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Brazil and Botswana: structural change important in launching into middle-income but tiny role thereafter
            \item Vietnam and Ghana: structural change significant contribution
            \item India, Nigeria Zambia: structural change different way. less rapid decline in the employment share of low-productivity agriculture, exacerbated by the lack of labor-intensive manufacturing for export.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Typology of growth patterns: structural transformation $\times$ Investment in fundamentals
        \item total labor productivity:\(P_t = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\theta_{i,t}P_{i,t}\). \\ Change in total labor productivity \(\Delta P_t = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\theta_{i,t-k}\Delta P_{i,t} + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\Delta P_{i,t-k} + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\Delta\theta_{i,t}\Delta P_{i,t}\)
        \item productivity change as sum of with-in sector change and structural change \[\Delta P_t = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\theta_{i,t-k}\Delta P_{i,t} + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}P_{i,t}\Delta \theta_{i,t}\]
